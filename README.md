## Getting Started

My name is Lexus Drumgold, but most people call me Lex. As both a UI designer
and JavaScript developer, I'm dedicated to crafting superior digital
experiences.

I got started in 2012 by teaching myself both UI design and development, and now
have four years of professional experience designing client sites and
applications, building custom user interfaces, as well as building and consuming
backend services using cloud infrastructure.

In February of 2019, I launched my own design and development company that
specializes in web and mobile projects. I use industry standard techniques and
practices to implement creative web and mobile solutions.

Using Github and Notion for project management and communication, my workflow
typically includes a requirements gathering session, UI design using Adobe XD,
development with (P)React, React Native, and/or FeathersJS, and hosting with
Google Firebase. Additionally, I have experience working with Sass, Next.js,
WordPress, and Google Analytics.  

## Usage

Flexpack is a Google Firebase project that currently redirects the Flex Development
domains to Flex Development Notion workspace. This is where you'll find information
about starting a project, as well as information about my workflow, tech stack,
and past experience. You'll find my portfolio projects there as well.

After installing the project dependencies, run `npm start` to mock the
`production` website.
