#### Overview
###### My name is Lexus Drumgold, but most people call me Lex. As both a designer and developer, I use industry standard techniques and practices to implement creative web and mobile solutions.
 
#### Experience

My design experience includes using Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and UXPin to
wireframe and prototype, as well as create simple, yet aesthetically pleasing
identity palettes and design systems. I also bring these designs to life using
front end technologies such as Sass, React.js, and mobile tools like React
Native. Additionally, I also have experience designing and building APIs using
Node.js to support these client side websites and applications.

For the last four years, I've worked on a pleathora of projects, in which I not
only created or integrated a cohesive brand identity, but increased brand value
as well. When I'm not designing or developing, I participate in design critiques
and code reviews to assess contribution to project goals and adherence to
industry standards as well.
