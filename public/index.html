    content="My name is Lexus Drumgold, but most people
  call me Lex. As both a UI designer and JavaScript developer, I'm dedicated to
  crafting superior digital experiences. In February of 2019, I launched my own design and development company that specializes in web and mobile projects. I use industry standard techniques and practices to implement creative web and mobile solutions. Using Github and Notion for project management and communication, my workflow typically includes a requirements gathering session, UI design using Adobe XD, development with (P)React, React Native, and/or FeathersJS, and hosting with Google Firebase. Additionally, I have experience working with Sass, Next.js, WordPress, and Google Analytics." />
